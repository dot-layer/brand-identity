# .Layer brand identity

This repo aims to regroup the graphical identity and the logo files of the .Layer community. To have more informations about the design and how exactly to use the logos, please read the `graphical-identity.pdf` file.

# Different logos

Here are the meaning of the content of each folder:

- `Full/`: Full logo without the slogan (Meet, Share & Learn).
- `Full_Tagline/`: Full logo with the slogan (Meet, Share & Learn).
- `Short/`: Short version of the logo.

Each folder contains multiple file format (`.ai`, `.png` and `.jpg`) and color/noncolor versions.
