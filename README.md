# .Layer brand identity

This repo aims to regroup the graphical identity and the logo files of the .Layer community. To have more informations about the design and how exactly to use the logos, please read the `graphical-identity.pdf` file.

This brand identity has been designed by [Jean-Christophe Yelle](jcyelle@pikur.ca), from [Pikur](https://www.pikur.ca/). Feel free to communicate with him for any questions.
